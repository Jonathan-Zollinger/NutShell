# Contributing

By participating in this project, you agree to abide our
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Set up your machine

[//]: # (TODO: add tech requirements and configuration. see https://github.com/Graqr/Threshr/blob/main/Contributing.md for an example)

fork your own instance of this repo, then clone your fork anywhere:

[//]: # (TODO: correct the below endpoint and finish setup instructions)
```shell
git clone git@github.com:Graqr/Threshr.git
```

## Branch off of main

It's a good practice not to put your changes in the main branch. Branch naming conventions aren't enforced, but I
personally like naming my branches with a `tag`/`task` convention. See [Create a commit](#create-a-commit) for other git best practices.

[//]: # (TODO: add style-guide reference, or create your own iteration from https://google.github.io/styleguide/)
See google's [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) for supported coding practices.
## Test your change

Adequate acceptance testing is to be included with pull requests for new code. See our testing documentation
